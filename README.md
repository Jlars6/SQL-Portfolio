# SQL-Portfolio
A collection of personal SQL projects to showcase my skills in database management, data manipulation, and data analysis. 

## Highlighted Project:
**Blockchain Use Cases**: Here, I explore potential use cases for SQL in Blockchain. Use cases include transaction transparency and auditing, Smart Contract performance tracking, asset tokenization management, and DeFi analytics. The tables were built from scratch with sample, generated data. [SQL](https://github.com/Jlars6/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/blockchain_usecases.sql)

### Other Projects:
**2024 Makeup Sales Analysis**: In this project, sales data was provided from a mid-size makeup company from January 2024 through July 2024 to analyze and review for profits, sales trends, regional insights, and customer behavioral trends. The table was built from scratch with sales data provided. [SQL](https://github.com/Jlars6/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/makeupsales.sql)

**January 2024 Fraud Detection**: For this project, flagged transaction activity was compiled from January 2024 to analyze for potential fraud. Transactions are flagged as fraudulent if they exceed three times the standard deviation. These tables were built from scratch with transaction activity provided.
